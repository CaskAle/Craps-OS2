:i1 id=main.&APPLNAME.
:p.&CAPPLNAME. is an authentic rendition of a Las Vegas style craps
game.  While the primary purpose of this game is entertainment, it also
provides helpful assistance and recommended strategies.
:p.Craps is the most exciting of all casino games.  It offers the player the
opportunity to win, or lose, large sums of money very quickly.  There are over
twenty different bets available in the game of craps.  The craps table is
divided into three distinct sections.  The two end sections are where the
majority of the bets are made.  The middle area, contains bets known as
proposition, or center, bets.
:p.Craps is played by betting on the outcome of the rolling of two dice.  In
order to properly understand and participate in the game of craps, it is
important to know the possible outcomes when two dice are thrown.  There are
eleven possible outcomes in a roll of two dice (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
11, and 12).  Certain numbers are more likely to be rolled than others.  The
chances of rolling a particular number are as follows:
:table cols='10 10'.
:row.
:c.Number
:c.Chance
:row.
:c.2 or 12
:c.1/36
:row.
:c.3 or 11
:c.2/36
:row.
:c.4 or 10
:c.3/36
:row.
:c.5 or 9
:c.4/36
:row.
:c.6 or 8
:c.5/36
:row.
:c.7
:c.6/36
:etable.
:p.Notice that the seven is the most common roll of all the possible rolls.
Notice, also, that there is a symmetry of combinations on either side of the
seven (ie.  the six and eight have the same odds, as do the four and ten).
The further a number is from seven, the less likely it will be rolled.  Based
on these chances of a number being rolled, the following odds can be derived:
:table cols='10 10'.
:row.
:c.Number
:c.Odds
:row.
:c.2 or 12
:c. 35 to 1
:row.
:c.3 or 11
:c. 17 to 1
:row.
:c.4 or 10
:c. 11 to 1
:row.
:c.5 or 9
:c.  8 to 1
:row.
:c.6 or 8
:c.6.2 to 1
:row.
:c.7
:c.  5 to 1
:etable.
:p.The casinos use these odds to their advantage in the game of craps.  When a
bet is won, it is typically paid off at an amount that is less than the true
odds of winning the bet.  All of the bets in the game favor the casino, or
house.  Some bets favor the house more than others.  The key to winning at the
game of craps is to play the bets that offer the lowest house advantage.
:p.Extensive help is available for every menu item and dialog box in the game.
The help information for each bet will contain the rules for that bet as well
as some recommended betting strategies.  All you need to do is select the
particular item that you want help for and press the F1 key.
:p.For more information on each of the menus on the action bar, double-click
on one of the following hilighted words (or press the Tab Key to select it and
press Enter).

:p.The :hp2.Pass Line:ehp2. bet is one of four bets known as line bets.  The
object of the Pass Line bet changes after the first roll of the dice.  The
first roll of the dice, after placing this bet, is referred to as the
:link refid=comeout reftype=fn.come out:elink. roll.  The object of the Pass
Line bet, on the come out roll, is to roll a seven or an eleven.  If you roll
a seven or eleven, you win.  If you roll a two, three, or twelve, you lose.
If any other number is rolled, that number becomes the
:link refid=point reftype=fn.point number:elink..  A place marker will then be
placed, on the table, over the number that corresponds to the point number.
:p.Once a point number is established, the object of the Pass Line bet is to
roll the point number before rolling a seven. If you roll the point number
first, you win.  If you roll a seven first, you lose.  If any other number is
rolled, it has no effect on this bet.

:dt.:hp2.Recommendation:ehp2.
:dd.The house has a 1.4% advantage on a Pass Line bet with no odds.  This is
one of the lowest house advantages in the game.  Because the  house has no
advantage at all on the odds bet, if you back the Pass Line bet with odds, the
house advantage on the total bet drops to 0.8% with single odds and further to
0.6% when playing double odds.  As you can see, the house advantage drops
significantly when playing odds.  Also, the more odds that are taken, the lower
the house advantage drops.  Therefore, when playing the Pass Line, always bet
the maximum allowable odds.  When betting a sum of money on the Pass Line,
always put as much of that sum as possible on the odds.  Line bets backed by
odds are the best bets in the game.

A roll of twelve is considered a standoff, or push.  If any other number is
rolled, that number becomes the
:link refid=point reftype=fn.come point number:elink..  Your bet will then be
placed, on the table, over the number that corresponds to the come point
number.
:p.Once a come point number is established, the object of the Don't Come bet is to
roll a seven before rolling the come point number.  If you roll a seven first, you
win.  If you roll the come point number first, you lose.  If any other number is
rolled, it has no effect on this bet.

no longer be changed or removed.  Once the come point number has been established, a
Don't Come bet can be enhanced with an :link reftype=hd res=&ODDS..odds:elink.
bet.  The odds bet is really a separate bet and it can be changed or removed at
any time.  Odds can only be placed after the come point number is established.
:dt.:hp2.Odds of winning:ehp2.

possible come point number.

:dt.:hp2.Payoff if won:ehp2.
:dd.The original Don't Come bet is paid off at even money regardless of the
come point number.  If Odds were taken on the bet, the odds are paid off according
to the come point number.  The following table gives the odds payoff for each
possible come point number.
:table cols='10 10'.

:c.5 or 9
:c.2 to 3
:row.
:c.6 or 8
:c.5 to 6
:etable.
:note.The odds of winning and the payoff are identical on the odds bet.  Also,
note that you will be paid off less than the actual bet.  This is because the
odds are actually in your favor on the Don't Come bet.  This serves to even it
up for the house.
:dt.:hp2.Recommendation:ehp2.
:dd.The house has a 1.4% advantage on a Don't Come bet with no odds.  This is
one of the lowest house advantages in the game.  Because the house has no
advantage at all on the odds bet, if you back the Don't Come bet with odds, the
house advantage on the total bet drops to 0.8% with single odds and further to
0.6% when playing double odds.  As you can see, the house advantage drops
significantly when playing odds.  Also, the more odds that are taken, the lower
the house advantage drops.  Therefore, when playing the Don't Come, always bet
the maximum allowable odds.  When betting a sum of money on the Don't Come,
always put as much of that sum as possible on the odds.  Line bets backed by
odds are the best bets in the game.

:h2 res=&ODDS..Free Odds - Help
:i2 refid=main.Free Odds
:p.A :hp2.Free Odds:ehp2. bet, or just :hp1.Odds:ehp1. bet, is an extension
to the line bets.  This bet must always back an existing line bet.  An Odds
bet can be placed for every existing line bet.  While the Free Odds bet looks
like a way to simply increase your line bet, it is much more than that.  The
Free Odds bet is paid of at the true odds.  Thus, the house gets no advantage
on this bet.  The Free Odds bet serves to lower the overall house advantage
on the line bets.
:p.The amount you are allowed to bet on a Free Odds bet is usually limited to
some multiple of the line bet that it backs.  The most common multiples are
:hp1.single odds:ehp1. and :hp1.double odds:ehp1..  In a single odds game,
the Free Odds bet can only be as large as the line bet that it backs.  When
playing double odds, the Free Odds bet can be up to two times the line bet.
The odds multiple can be set in the
:link reftype=hd res=&IDH_SETTINGS_EXT..Settings dialog:elink..
:dl tsize=2 break=all.
:dt.:hp2.Place:ehp2.
:dd.This bet can only be made as a backing bet to one of the line bets.
Therefore, you must have already placed one of the line bets, and the
corresponding point number must be established.  You must have enough money in
your bank to place the minimum bet.  The minimum bet is set in the :link

:dt.:hp2.Odds of winning:ehp2.

point number is.  The following table gives the odds of winning for each
possible point number.

:note.The odds of winning and the payoff are identical on the Free Odds bet.
:dt.:hp2.Recommendation:ehp2.
:dd.The house has no advantage at all on a Free Odds bet.  This makes the
Free Odds bet the best bet in the game.  The overall house advantage for
line bets decreases as more money is bet on the Free Odds backing the line
bet.  For this reason, line bets should always be backed with the maximum
allowable Free Odds bet.
